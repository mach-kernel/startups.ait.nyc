						In Your Office</h2>
						<p>It is inevitable -- computers, smartphones, tablets; they are all an integral part of doing business in the modern world. Whether you are a designer, engineer, or business person, your technology should work for you. Not the other way around.</p>

						<p>Awesome IT is located in the heart of New York City. We are never more than a train ride away.</p>

							<h3>Perpetual Connectivity</h3>
							<p>As the owner of a startup, you know that your work doesn't end when you leave the office. Access your data (and even your workstation) from anywhere, anytime, and any device. No third party services. Your ideas live on your servers -- no-one else's.</p>

							<h3>Rock-Solid Backups and Security</h3>
							<p>As you develop your product, you want to focus on your work -- not on potential data loss and security holes. We audit our systems to ensure airtight security, and our secure off-site/on-site hybrid backups are 100% effective. We can re-deploy a machine as it was in a matter of minutes. No more lost time. No more lost anything.</p>
